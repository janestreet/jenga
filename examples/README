hello-explicit

    A first example of using the jenga API.
    This is really an `anti' example showing how not to use jenga.

simple-make-style

    Shows how jenga can be setup to read simple static rule triple
    from a config file in a simple/terse make-style format.

        target1 target2 : dep1 dep2 dep3
            action

    This kind of setup is useful to automate rebuilding a collection
    of small projects, where you are happy to maintain explicitly all
    the dependencies by hand.


compile-and-link

    And older example. Needs to be adapted to Api_v2.
    

simple-ocaml-build

    Compiles and links a directory of .ml/i, using ocamldep for dependency discovery

    
better-make-style

    Example to show the new fixpoint based discovery of buildable_targets
    Using make-style config to drive.
    
    Improvements over `simple-make-style' include
    - glob-dependencies (i.e. *.o)
    - percent style rules (%.o : %.c)
    - definition of @$ $< etc

    This example also included rules to extract a real Makefile from jenga's rules,
    forcing the build of only what is needed to discover the full static build.

    jenga Makefile.extracted-from-jenga
    make -f Makefile.extracted-from-jenga
